## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-server.git
    cd express-server
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    node index.js
    ```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:10000`.

## Usage

The server is configured to handle JSON requests and includes routes for creating, retrieving, and managing data.

## CORS Configuration

The server uses the `cors` middleware to allow requests from specific origins. The allowed origins are defined in the `corsOptions` object:

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
    origin : [
        "https://darling-haupia-9df6eb.netlify.app",
        "https://silver-cocada-d4c693.netlify.app",
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "https://adorable-paprenjak-da864c.netlify.app"
    ],
    credentials : true
}
```
### Routes
## The server includes the following routes:
- POST /create: Route to create new data.
- GET /get: Route to retrieve data
- GET /data: Route to manage data

  ## These routes are defined in the userRoutes module.

  app.use('/create', routes);
app.use('/get', routes);
app.use('/data', routes);

### Database Connection
## The server connects to a database using the dbConnection module:

const dbConnection = require("./DbConnection/dbConnection");
dbConnection();

Ensure your database connection details are properly configured in the dbConnection module.
